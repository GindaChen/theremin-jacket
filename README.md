## Areas of Concern

- [ ] **Infrared LED Safety to eye**: To design a better tracking of hand while not directly influence users’ eye is a design challenge, and that might require some research in the [area](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/13691/is-it-safe-to-look-at-infrared-leds).





## Past Development Log
